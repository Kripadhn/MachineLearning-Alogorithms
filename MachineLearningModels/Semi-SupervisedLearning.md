4. Semi-Supervised Learning: Semi-supervised learning algorithms use a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to learn the underlying structure of the data. The goal is to leverage the unlabeled data to improve the performance of the model on the labeled data.

Problem: Predicting the sentiment of customer reviews, given a small labeled dataset and a large unlabeled dataset. 
Solution (using self-training):

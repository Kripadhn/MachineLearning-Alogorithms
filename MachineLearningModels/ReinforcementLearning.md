1. Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning algorithms are used to train an agent to make decisions in an environment by maximizing a reward signal. The agent learns from trial and error, gradually improving its decision-making over time.

Problem: Teaching an agent to play a game of chess.
Solution (using Q-Learning):


--------------

2. Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions in an environment by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties. The goal is for the agent to learn a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time.

Problem: Robotics, given a robot that needs to navigate a maze and reach a target.
Solution (using Q-Learning):

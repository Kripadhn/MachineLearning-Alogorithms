1. Model: A mathematical representation of a real-world phenomenon that can be used to make predictions.
2. Algorithm: A set of steps that can be followed to perform a specific task.
3. Training: The process of using a dataset to fit a model to the data. The goal is to find the best parameters for the model that minimize the error between the predicted output and the true output.
4. Test set: A set of data that is used to evaluate the performance of a model. The test set is used to estimate the generalization error of a model, which is a measure of how well the model will perform on unseen data.
5. Overfitting: The phenomenon where a model fits the training data too closely and does not generalize well to new data.
6. Underfitting: The phenomenon where a model is too simple and cannot capture the underlying patterns in the data.
7. Regularization: A technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function used to train the model.
8. Hyperparameters: Parameters that control the behavior of a machine learning algorithm, such as the learning rate, the number of hidden units in a neural network, or the regularization strength.
9. Bias: The error introduced by the model's assumptions about the relationship between the input and the output.
10. Variance: The error introduced by the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the data.
11. Confusion Matrix: A matrix used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, where each cell represents the number of instances that are classified as a certain class.
12. Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions.
13. Recall: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive instances in the dataset.
14. F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, which provides a balanced measure of the performance of a classification model.
15. ROC Curve: A plot that shows the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate for different threshold values of a binary classifier.
16. AUC: The area under the ROC curve, which provides a single measure of the performance of a binary classifier.
17. Gradient Descent: An optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a cost function. It involves updating the parameters of the model in the direction of the negative gradient of the cost function.
18. Stochastic Gradient Descent: A variation of gradient descent that uses a randomly selected subset of the data to update the parameters in each iteration. This helps to escape from local minima and leads to faster convergence.
19. Momentum: A technique used to accelerate the convergence of gradient descent by adding a fraction of the previous update to the current update.
20. Backpropagation: An algorithm used to calculate the gradients in a neural network by propagating the error backwards through the network.
21. Dropout: A regularization technique used in neural networks that randomly drops out neurons during the training process to prevent overfitting.
22. Early Stopping: A technique used to prevent overfitting by stopping the training process when the performance on a validation set stops improving.
23. Ensemble Learning: A technique that combines the predictions of multiple models to make a final prediction. This can improve the performance of the model by reducing the variance or bias of the individual models.
24. Cross-Validation: A technique used to evaluate the performance of a model by splitting the data into multiple folds and using each fold as a validation set.
25. Grid Search: A technique used to tune the hyperparameters of a model by training the model with different combinations of hyperparameters and selecting the best combination based on the performance on a validation set.
26. Random Search: A technique used to tune the hyperparameters of a model by sampling random combinations of hyperparameters and selecting the best combination based on the performance on a validation set.
27. Feature Selection: The process of selecting a subset of the input features to use in a model. This can improve the performance of the model by reducing overfitting, improving the interpretability of the model, or speeding up the training process.
28. Dimensionality Reduction: The process of transforming the input features into a lower-dimensional space. This can improve the performance of the model by removing redundant or irrelevant features, speeding up the training process, or making the data easier to visualize.
29. Model Complexity: Refers to the degree of freedom or the number of parameters in a model. Models with high complexity have more parameters and can fit the training data more closely, but they are also more prone to overfitting.
30. Overfitting: Occurs when a model fits the training data too closely, leading to poor performance on unseen data. Overfitting can be prevented by using regularization techniques or by reducing the model complexity.
31. Underfitting: Occurs when a model is too simple to capture the true relationship between the input features and the output. Underfitting can be prevented by increasing the model complexity or by using more expressive models.
32. Hyperparameters: Refers to the parameters of a model that are set before the training process begins. These parameters control the learning rate, the regularization strength, the number of hidden layers, etc. Hyperparameters are typically tuned using cross-validation or grid search.
33. Regularization: Refers to the techniques used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function. The most common forms of regularization are L1 regularization, L2 regularization, and dropout.
34. Loss Function: Refers to a mathematical function that measures the difference between the predicted output and the true output. The goal of training a machine learning model is to minimize the value of the loss function.
35. Bias-Variance Tradeoff: Refers to the tradeoff between the ability of a model to fit the training data (bias) and the ability of a model to generalize to new data (variance). In general, models with high complexity have high variance and low bias, while models with low complexity have high bias and low variance.
36. Model Selection: Refers to the process of selecting the best model for a given problem by comparing the performance of multiple models on a validation set. Model selection involves choosing the right model architecture, tuning the hyperparameters, and selecting the best features.
37. Model Evaluation: Refers to the process of evaluating the performance of a model on a test set after the training process has been completed. The goal of model evaluation is to measure the generalization error, which is a measure of how well the model will perform on unseen data.
38. Confusion Matrix: A table that is used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model. The confusion matrix shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for a given threshold.
39. Precision-Recall Curve: A plot that is used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model. The precision-recall curve shows the precision (the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions) and recall (the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive instances) as a function of the threshold.
40. ROC Curve: A plot that is used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model. The ROC curve shows the false positive rate and true positive rate as a function of the threshold.
